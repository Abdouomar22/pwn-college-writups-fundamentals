WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : shellscript
- the challenge will check that input is redirected from a specific file path : /tmp/tgbqhi
- the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : beykcype

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] Checking to make sure the process is a non-interactive shell script.
[GOOD] You have passed the checks on the parent process!
[TEST] You should have redirected a file called /tmp/tgbqhi to my stdin. Checking...
[TEST] I will now check that you redirected /tmp/tgbqhi to/from my stdin.

[ADVICE] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[ADVICE] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[ADVICE] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.
[GOOD] The file at the other end of my stdin looks okay!
[TEST] This program expects you to enter a simple password (specifically, beykcype). Send it now!
[INFO] Reading in your input now...
[GOOD] You successfully passed the password!
[GOOD] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements. Here is your flag:
